This repository contains the materials for D-Lab LLMs for Exploratory Research in R workshop. 

### Prerequisites

No prior experience in using LLMs is necessary for this workshop.

Check D-Lab's [Learning Pathways](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/python_path.html) to figure out which of our workshops to take!

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we assess the different uses of LLMs in exploratory research and discusses ways to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in various phases of exploratory research. First, we’ll cover some of the different types of LLMs that can be useful for research. Then, we’ll explore the use cases of LLMs specifically for exploratory research. As we go along, we will discuss the strengths and limitations of using LLMs for research.  


## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Use LLMs for tasks related to exploratory research.
- Compare and contrast outputs from different LLMs.

This workshop does not cover the following:

- How to use LLMs for coding. These are covered in [Copilot Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Copilot-Fundamentals).
- Introduction to GPT models. These are covered in [Python GPT Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Python-GPT-Fundamentals?search=1).


## Installation Instructions

RStudio is a software commonly used by R practitioners to develop code in R. We will use RStudio to go through the workshop materials, which requires the installation of both the R language and the RStudio software. If you would like to run R on your own computer, complete the following steps prior to the workshop:

1. [Download R](https://cloud.r-project.org/): Follow the links according to the operating system you are running. You will first need to click on a link corresponding to your operating system, and then an additional link to select a specific version of R. Download the package, and install R onto your computer. You should install the most recent version (at least version 4.1).
   - If you are using a Mac, click "Download R for macOS" and then select the right version of R. You will need to select the version corresponding to your specific version of macOS, as well as whether you have an Intel or Apple Silicon Mac.
   - If you are using Windows, click "Download R for Windows", then click "base", and click the download link.
   - If you are using Linux, click on the link corresponding to your Linux distribution, and then follow the instructions.
2. [Download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download): Install RStudio Desktop. This should be free. Do this after you have already installed R. The D-Lab strongly recommends an RStudio edition of 2022.02.0+443 "Prairie Trillium" or higher.
   - Some individuals with older operating systems may run into odd issues. If you are running into issues with the installation of RStudio, you may need to install a specific version of RStudio. Please check [this link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/older-versions/) if this applies to you.
3. Download these LLMs for Exploratory Research workshop materials:
   - Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
   - Click "Download Zip".
   - Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).
4. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering `git clone git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/LLMs-Exploratory-Research.git`.

## Is R not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have R installed and the materials loaded on your
workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley
Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by
clicking the following button:

[![DataHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FR-LLMs-Exploratory-Research&urlpath=rstudio%2F)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and
allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers.
No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser
and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come
back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go
straight to the [D-Lab DataHub](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and
you click on the `LLMs-Exploratory-Research` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dlab-berkeley/R-LLMs-Exploratory-Research/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

By using this button, however, you cannot save your work.


# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.
